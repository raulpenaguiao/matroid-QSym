# matroid-QSym
Python scripts used to compute chromatic invariants on matroids

### Set compositions ###
This file lists all set compositions of a given size, and provides a handful of functions that allows us to manipulate them

### matroids ###
This file gives us functions to compute QSym and WQSym functions from matroids, as well as functionality to compute the dimention of the image and the kernel of these maps.

### Schubert matroids ###
This computes the basis of a schubert matroid

Computing Quasi-symmetric functions on Matroids

### Known bugs and future features ###

 - There is still no function to compute the WQSym 
 - How to run me
 - Examples for given matroids
 - Optimize to compute WQSym by using "opi <= otau and opi is M-generic implies otau is M-generic"
 - Optimize to compute by using "alpha ( opi ) = 1...1 implies opi is M-generic"
